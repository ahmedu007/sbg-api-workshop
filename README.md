# SBG API workshop

Introduction to JS and API testing using Supertest and Jest

---

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repo, then run:

```
npm install
```

or if you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed then

```
yarn
```

---

### Starting local server

Once all the dependencies have been installed, please run

```
npm start
```

or

```
yarn start
```

This will open up a server pointing at http://localhost:3000.

The endpoints are all CRUD, so using POSTMAN or something similar, we can modify data if needed.
